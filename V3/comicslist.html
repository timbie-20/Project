                    by a default numbering system of 1, 2, 3, etc. In this particular case,
                    the comics will be sorted by date of last update. Because the numbering
                    will change frequently, especially if there's a large number of items
                    in the list, this list will not have explicitly defined values.

                This table houses the summaries of the comics that are going to be on the site.
                It makes use of a caption, columns with certain ID's, etc. It also uses th cells
                to separate the single-story strips from the comic series; other cells for housing data
                are stored in td cells. Additionally, it uses header cells for the labels that apply
                to all columns ("Comic Name", "Summary", and "Last Updated").
