     M1LO6 Demonstrate the use of basic HTML tags to create a simple Web page

     The HTML tags listed divide the document into head and body sections,
     as well as header, article, and footer sections to logically organize the text
     into various sections. The HTML tags also define the style in individual sections
     of the page.

            The unordered list here provides hyperlinks for navigation to internal pages.
            Since all of these files are in the same directory folder as this page,
            only the file name is necessary to provide the link to each page.

        <h3 id="V1">V1 Update: May 7, 2020</h3>
        <p style="font-weight:normal;">
            V1 is the first update of my site. As of this update, the only available pages are my home page, briefly describing what the website contain and
            the context behind it; this About page, describing changes in each update of the site; and an index for comics that will be posted in the future.
        </p>

        <h3 id="V2">V2 Update: May 16, 2020</h3>
        <p style="font-weight:normal;">
            V2 is the second update of this site. Additional images were added, extra features and graphics were added to page elements, and the first page
            of the "Pop Culture Asides" comic is added.
        </p>

        <h3 id="V3">V3 Update: May 30, 2020</h3>
        <p style="font-weight:normal;">
            V3 is the third update of this site. Added a table featuring comic summaries and media formatting for devices of smaller screen width (such as
            mobile). Certain features from the previous iterations that made the site clunky were replaced.
