    element properties for certain types of elements in the document.

/*
    M2LO15 Apply colors using CSS

    The following color for the HTML page background was chosen using the HSL
    color model. The hue, saturation, and lightness were chosen in order to
    grab a dark blue color.
*/

html {
    background-color: hsl(237, 40%, 35%);
}

body {

    font-family: Arial, Verdana, "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
    color:whitesmoke;
    font-size:1em;

    /* Web-safe fonts selected from WebSiteSetup.org <https://websitesetup.org/web-safe-fonts-html-css/> */

}

/*
    M2LO7 Demonstrate a CSS attribute selector other than class or id

    The following rule uses the alt text attribute to determine how images with
    the "H-Clip Art" alt text should be sized.
*/

/*
    M2LO12 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of page elements

    Non-textual page elements like images can have properties like size altered.
    In the example below, header images with a certain alt tag are set by this
    style to have a fixed height of 250 px.
*/

header img[alt="H-Clip Art"] {
    height:250px;
}

/*
    M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS
        
    Precedence: as a more specific rule, the following style rule will cause h1 
    text in the header to render with a different background color and text than
    the rest of the body, of which it is a descendant.
*/
/*
    M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors

    The following style rule demonstrates the child selector, where any
    h1 element that is a child of the header, but not necessarily a
    descendant of other sections like the body, will receive these rules.
*/
/*
    M2LO14 Demonstrate and explain the use of progressive enhancement in CSS
    
    In the following style, there are two background color properties. Since some older browsers
    may not support color transparency that's defined in the a value of the rgba model, an
    alternative color is listed above it using simple rgb.
*/

header > h1 {
    font-family: "Arial Black";
    font-size:2em;
    background-color: rgb(85, 105, 145);
    background-color: rgba(85, 105, 145, 0.7);
    
}

/*
    M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-element selector
    
    The pseudo-element selector for the first letter of an element is used
    here. In this case it is used to enlarge the first letter of H1 headings in
    the header.
*/

header > h1::first-letter {
    font-size:1.6em;
    font-style:initial;
}


h1 {
    font-family: "Arial Black";
    font-size:1.8em;
}

h2 {
    font-family: "Verdana";
    font-size:1.45em;
    color:hsl(45,36%,71%);
}
/*
    M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS
        
    Inheritance: because the following style rule for unordered lists does not specify a font 
    family, unordered lists in the page body will inherit the default font 
    family from the "body" rules above.
*/
ul {
    background-color:olive;
}

/*
    M2LO13 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of textual elements

    The style below applies a bolder font weight to elements whose class is designated
    "page-intros". 
*/

.page-intros {
    font-weight: bolder;
}

/*
    M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-class

    The following style rule uses a specific type of pseudo-class for links, which
    applies whenever a link on the page is being hovered over by the cursor. It 
    turns the link light coral when the mouse is placed over the link. Because the
    "a" selector here is not a descendant of anything, it will apply to all links
    on the page.
*/

a:hover{
    color:lightcoral;
}

/*
    M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors

    The following style rule demonstrates the descendant selector, where these rules
    apply to any hyperlink element that is a descendant of, or part of, an article element.
    This will render each hyperlink in the font described.
*/

article a {
    font-style:italic;
    color:rgb(184, 77, 202);

aside a {
    color:lavender;
