/*
    M2LO15 Apply colors using CSS

    The following color for the HTML page background was chosen using the HSL
    color model. The hue, saturation, and lightness were chosen in order to
    grab a dark blue color.
*/

/*
    M4LO4 Demonstrate the use of gradients

    Here, a linear gradient is used to change the monochrome background to one that
    gradually changes from dark blue on top to lighter on bottom. Any space extending 
    beyond the footer just receives the regular monochrome background.
*/

html {
    background: hsl(237, 40%, 35%);
    background: linear-gradient(hsl(237, 40%, 35%), hsl(214, 53%, 70%));
}

body {

    font-family: Arial, Verdana, "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
    color:whitesmoke;
    font-size:1em;

    /* Web-safe fonts selected from WebSiteSetup.org <https://websitesetup.org/web-safe-fonts-html-css/> */

}

/*
    M2LO7 Demonstrate a CSS attribute selector other than class or id

    The following rule uses the alt text attribute to determine how images with
    the "H-Clip Art" alt text should be sized.
*/

/*
    M2LO12 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of page elements

    Non-textual page elements like images can have properties like size altered.
    In the example below, header images with a certain alt tag are set by this
    style to have a fixed height of 250 px.
*/

header img[alt="H-Clip Art"] {
    height:250px;
}

/*
    M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS
        
    Precedence: as a more specific rule, the following style rule will cause h1 
    text in the header to render with a different background color and text than
    the rest of the body, of which it is a descendant.
*/
/*
    M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors

    The following style rule demonstrates the child selector, where any
    h1 element that is a child of the header, but not necessarily a
    descendant of other sections like the body, will receive these rules.
*/
/*
    M2LO14 Demonstrate and explain the use of progressive enhancement in CSS
    
    In the following style, there are two background color properties. Since some older browsers
    may not support color transparency that's defined in the a value of the rgba model, an
    alternative color is listed above it using simple rgb.
*/

header > h1 {
    font-family: "Arial Black";
    font-size:2em;
    background-color: rgb(85, 105, 145);
    background-color: rgba(85, 105, 145, 0.7);
    
}

/*
    M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-element selector
    
    The pseudo-element selector for the first letter of an element is used
    here. In this case it is used to enlarge the first letter of H1 headings in
    the header.
*/

header > h1::first-letter {
    font-size:1.6em;
    font-style:initial;
}


h1 {
    font-family: "Arial Black";
    font-size:1.8em;
}

h2 {
    font-family: "Verdana";
    font-size:1.45em;
    color:hsl(45,36%,71%);
}

/*
    M3LO2 Demonstrate floating elements

    Since I initially wanted the nav element to be floated to the right of the
    page (for a more visually appealing navigation bar), the "float" property allows
    me to do that by moving the box over to the right side of the parent (article in
    most cases)
*/

nav {
    display: block;
    float: right;
    width: 15%;
    top: 10px;
    box-shadow: black 7px 7px 15px;

}

/*
    M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS
        
    Inheritance: because the following style rule for unordered lists does not specify a font 
    family, unordered lists in the page body will inherit the default font 
    family from the "body" rules above.
*/

ul {
    background-color:rgb(170, 170, 91);
    float: center;
}

ul > li {
    display: block;
    float: center;
    text-align: center;
}

/*
    M2LO13 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of textual elements

    The style below applies a bolder font weight to elements whose class is designated
    "page-intros". 
*/

.page-intros {
    font-weight: bolder;
}

/*
    M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-class

    The following style rule uses a specific type of pseudo-class for links, which
    applies whenever a link on the page is being hovered over by the cursor. It 
    turns the link light coral when the mouse is placed over the link. Because the
    "a" selector here is not a descendant of anything, it will apply to all links
    on the page.
*/

a:hover{
    color:lightcoral;
}


/*
    M3LO10 Demonstrate an overflow setting

    As a comic page, the article of the body should extend as far down as necessary to
    contain the page image inside, in order to enhance the reading experience (as opposed
    to having an internal bounding box with its own scroller, which would make reading
    difficult). Thus the "visible" overflow property and the lack of dimensions for the
    article help accomplish this by expanding the article box as necessary.
*/

article {
    overflow: visible;
}



/*
    M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors

    The following style rule demonstrates the descendant selector, where these rules
    apply to any hyperlink element that is a descendant of, or part of, an article element.
    This will render each hyperlink in the font described.
*/

article a {
    font-style:italic;
    color:rgb(184, 77, 202);
}

aside a {
    color:lavender;
}

/*
    M3LO3 Demonstrate a clearing floats

    This style rule makes sure that the article area is clear of floats (namely the nav
    box) so that it can start when that area is clear, avoiding possible interference in 
    case of different window sizes.
*/

section.page-holder{
    display: block;
    clear: both;
    width: 90%;
    position: static;
}


article img.comic-image {
    display: block;
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 22%;
    width: 50%;
}

figure#right-arrow {
    position:absolute;
    left:75%;
    top: 800px;
}

/*
    M3LO11 Demonstrate -prefix- style browser extensions use in CSS

    The following rule includes a -webkit version and a regular version of the transform
    function, for compatibility with older browsers.
*/

/*
    M4LO8 Demonstrate the use of transformations for 2D or 3D images

    When the right arrow on a page is hovered over, it "squishes". The transforms help
    accomplish this. 
*/

figure#right-arrow:hover {
    -webkit-transform: scale(1.3, 0.7);
    transform: scale(1.3, 0.7);
}

p.comic-footnotes {
    clear: both;
    width: 40%;
}

/*
    M3LO9 Demonstrate fixed, static, or inherited positioning

    The following footer section uses static positioning to ensure that it
    is not relocated relative to its bounding box, but rather that it is placed
    where it normally would - near the bottom of the window.
*/

footer {
    clear: both;
    font-size:0.8em;
    position:static;
    bottom: 40px;
